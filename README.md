# MCEW-algorithm-design
## About MCEW
MCEW stands for Multi-Center Esau-Williams. MCEW algorithm solves the problem in multi-center local access network design. The algorithm builds a set of trees that connect each access node to a backbone node, and finally constructs a forest of trees â€“ often not interconnected.  
The mentioned concepts can be found in the theory of **Access network design**.
